## Problem

Pentland et al. stressed the importance of relationships and how it is essential to a team’s success. Their research has shown that interpersonal conversations and social interactions have improved engagement, employee experience, and productivity. However, not every team communicates efficiently nor has strong relationships with one another. The problem we will be focusing on is communication and building trust between teams and team members.

Jong et al. states in their article that negative relationships within the team influences team performance. Research has shown that interpersonal relations marked with animosity can reduce team cohesion and induce team conflicts. Moreover, Jong et al. mentions team members who experience negative emotions can influence and produce a native climate. This, in turn, can obstruct communication within the team. For instance, Jong et al. states in this type of environment team members can withhold information or sabotage another colleague.  In contrast, positive interactions have shown to promote a positive and more welcoming environment. The authors state that effective communications within the teams can soften negative experiences experienced by some team members. Similarly, positive interactions can offset negative relationships within teams.

No matter the project the team is working on, whether that be a technical project or theoretical project, team conflict is unavoidable. There is an existing app called [IceBreaker: Have Better Dates](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icebreaker-have-better-dates/id1304625074?mt=8) that provides questions for couples on a first date. The problem with this app is that there is no category of questions to pick from, no option to pick what question comes up and no flexibility to edit or add a question. If a user wants to talk about a topic they are comfortable with but random questions they do not want to answer repeatedly appear, it may lead to frustration and cause tension between the pair.

Additionally, [Poll Everywhere][08b905c4] does introduce the ability to present flexible questions. However, the overall design of the application is too complicated for both the participant and poll creator. Moreover, from the participants perspective, there isn’t a motivating factor that promotes interpersonal communication. This, in turn, does not foster relationships between teammates and would not be particularly effective in utilizing for the purpose of building or strengthening relationships.

Another existing application that also provides a fun break from work is [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) Kahoot! is a program, in which a teacher in a classroom setting can create questions for the students to answer. There is an option for Kahoot! to participate as teams, and this provides an opportunity for team bonding. However, this program does not give students the opportunity to get to know one another, and bond over shared interests as the program was designed to be a review of students’ knowledge in class.

A new solution is needed in order to address the difficulties team members experience when working on a team project. There is a large gap within current solutions being implemented in terms of its ability to allow members to get to know each other and integrating face-to-face talking. This gap makes it difficult for team members to move past the stage of being “in the same group” to “acquaintances or friends”. Therefore, the solution outlined below revolves around getting team members to know each other and an opportunity to move the relationship past the initial uncomfortableness.
